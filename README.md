This is a guide on installing my Star Wars conversion modlist for Starfield, as seen on YouTube and featured on IGN and other sources. Just beware this is still a work in progress and this GitHub page will be updated periodically.

**Requirements:**
1. Decent Gaming PC. Make sure unmodded Starfield alone runs fine on your PC before attempting these mods. If you're lagging after installing these mods with a budget build, you can disable the HD Overhaul and uninstall the Reshade to alleviate it.
2. Steam version of Starfield. Alot of these mods have posts about people having issues installing it on the GamePass version and some of them straight up aren't compatible.
3. Mod Organizer 2. You can use Vortex but I can't promise it'll work. I have a portable MO2 install just for Starfield which I highly recommend. It makes things alot easier to troubleshoot and test if you run into any issues
4. Version 1.10.32 of Starfield. That's right before the big update that added land vehicles. Most of these mods will work on the new version as they've been updated by now but a select few won't. I am currently working on converting this modlist to the new version so please be patient. For now if you want the best experience, consider downgrading your Starfield version



**Manually Installed Mods:**<br />
1. Starfield Script Extender (V0.26 if you're using Starfield V1.10.32): https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/106?tab=files
2. Mandalorian Collection Mesh Texture Edits: https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/6043?tab=files
   Install just the main file. You can look into doing the optional muscular mando version if you're interested in that.
3. Starfield Hotkeys: https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/1578?tab=files
   Just install normally

**F.A.Q.**
1. How do I get the Mandalorian Armor?<br />
   It replaces the Mantis Armor. You can spawn the armor in with these console commands:
   player.additem 00226299<br />
   player.additem 0016640A<br />
   player.additem 0016640B<br />
2. How do I make the damage more realistic?<br />
   Everyone has different preferences on this so you can get whichever difficulty/damage mod you think you would like.
3. I see the Star Wars themed weapons but they don't fire lasers. How do I fix this?<br />
   Make sure all the Weapon Replacer mods are BELOW the Armor mods and overwrite them. Do the same for the esm files.
4. I see "Lookup failed!" on some weapons and armor. How do I fix?<br />
   If you see this on a select few weapons, then it's normal and part of the WIP nature of this modlist. If ALL weapons are like that then it could be anything tbh. Game version mismatch, save issue, mod outdated, etc.
