This is a guide on installing my Star Wars conversion modlist for Starfield, as seen on YouTube and featured on IGN and other sources. Just beware this is still a work in progress and this GitHub page will be updated periodically.

**Requirements:**
1. Decent Gaming PC. Make sure unmodded Starfield alone runs fine on your PC before attempting these mods. If you're lagging after installing these mods with a budget build, you can disable the HD Overhaul and uninstall the Reshade to alleviate it.
2. Steam version of Starfield. Alot of these mods have posts about people having issues installing it on the GamePass version and some of them straight up aren't compatible.
3. Mod Organizer 2. You can use Vortex but I can't promise it'll work. I have a portable MO2 install just for Starfield which I highly recommend. It makes things alot easier to troubleshoot and test if you run into any issues


Manually Installed Mods:
Starfield Script Extender

**F.A.Q.**
1. How do I get the Mandalorian Armor?
   It replaces the Mantis Armor. You can spawn the armor in with these console commands:
   player.additem 00226299
   player.additem 0016640A
   player.additem 0016640B
