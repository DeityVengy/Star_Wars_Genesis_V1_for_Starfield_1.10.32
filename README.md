This is a guide on installing my Star Wars conversion modlist for Starfield, as seen on YouTube and featured on IGN and other sources. Just beware this is still a work in progress and this GitHub page will be updated periodically.

**Requirements:**
1. Decent Gaming PC. Make sure unmodded Starfield alone runs fine on your PC before attempting these mods. If you're lagging after installing these mods with a budget build, you can disable the HD Overhaul and uninstall the Reshade to alleviate it.
2. Steam version of Starfield. Alot of these mods have posts about people having issues installing it on the GamePass version and some of them straight up aren't compatible.
3. Mod Organizer 2. You can use Vortex but I can't promise it'll work. I have a portable MO2 install just for Starfield which I highly recommend. It makes things alot easier to troubleshoot and test if you run into any issues
4. Version 1.10.32 of Starfield. That's right before the big update that added land vehicles. Most of these mods will work on the new version as they've been updated but this guide is specifically for version 1.10.32 so you can replicate my video as close as possible. I will work on making another modlist for the updated version soon and it'll have instructions similar to this.

**Experimental Mods:**<br />
1. Starfield Ultimate Graphics with SSRTGI (Reshade): https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/1565?tab=files<br />
   Idk much about reshade but this made my screen weird. If you have same issue, check all the Depth Buffer boxes in the Reshade Menu. You might still see the same issue in menus
   
**F.A.Q.**
1. How do I get the Mandalorian Armor?<br />
   It replaces the Mantis Armor. You can spawn the armor in with these console commands: <br />
   player.additem 00226299<br />
   player.additem 0016640A<br />
   player.additem 0016640B<br />
3. How do I make the damage more realistic?<br />
   Everyone has different preferences on this so you can get whichever difficulty/damage mod you think you would like.
4. I see the Star Wars themed weapons but they don't fire lasers. How do I fix this?<br />
   Make sure all the Weapon Replacer mods are BELOW the Armor mods and overwrite them. Do the same for the esm files.
5. I see "Lookup failed!" on some weapons and armor. How do I fix?<br />
   If you see this on a select few weapons, then it's normal and part of the WIP nature of this modlist. If ALL weapons are like that then it could be anything tbh. Game version mismatch, save issue, mod outdated, etc.
